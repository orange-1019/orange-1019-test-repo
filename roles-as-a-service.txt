"Roles-as-a-Service stack" and "RJ stacks." Based on my search, "Roles-as-a-Service" typically refers to IAM roles in cloud services like AWS CloudFormation12, while "RJ stacks" doesn't seem to be a recognized term in the context of cloud services or automation templates.

However, I can guide you through creating an automation template to convert IAM roles in an AWS CloudFormation stack to another format or service. Let's assume you want to convert these roles to a different IAM role configuration within the same AWS environment. Here's a detailed step-by-step guide with an example:

Steps to Convert IAM Roles in AWS CloudFormation Stack
Identify Existing IAM Roles:

List all IAM roles in your current CloudFormation stack.
Use the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs to retrieve this information.
Create a New CloudFormation Template:

Define the new IAM roles and policies you want to implement.
Ensure the new roles have the necessary permissions and trust relationships.
Update the CloudFormation Stack:

Use the new template to update the existing stack.
Ensure that the update process does not disrupt ongoing services.
Example
Step 1: Identify Existing IAM Roles
Use the AWS CLI to list IAM roles:

aws iam list-roles
Step 2: Create a New CloudFormation Template
Here's an example of a CloudFormation template that defines a new IAM role:

AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Resources:
  NewIAMRole:
    Type: 'AWS::IAM::Role'
    Properties:
      RoleName: 'NewRole'
      AssumeRolePolicyDocument:
        Version: '2012-10-17'
        Statement:
          - Effect: 'Allow'
            Principal:
              Service: 'ec2.amazonaws.com'
            Action: 'sts:AssumeRole'
      Policies:
        - PolicyName: 'NewPolicy'
          PolicyDocument:
            Version: '2012-10-17'
            Statement:
              - Effect: 'Allow'
                Action:
                  - 's3:ListBucket'
                  - 's3:GetObject'
                Resource: '*'
Step 3: Update the CloudFormation Stack
Use the AWS CLI to update the stack with the new template:

aws cloudformation update-stack --stack-name YourStackName --template-body file://new-template.yaml
Conclusion
This example demonstrates how to create and update IAM roles within an AWS CloudFormation stack. If you have a specific target format or service for the conversion, please provide more details, and I can tailor the instructions accordingly.
